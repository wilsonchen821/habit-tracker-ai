# LinkedIn Post Template: Habit Tracker AI

---

🚀 **Just built my first AI-powered web app!**

I'm excited to share **Habit Tracker AI** — an intelligent habit tracking application that learns from your patterns and provides personalized insights.

## 🎯 What It Does

Users can:
- Track daily habits with a simple, beautiful interface
- Monitor streaks and completion rates
- Get **AI-powered insights** that analyze their habits and offer personalized recommendations

## 🧠 The AI Magic

The app uses GLM's AI to:
- Identify strengths in your habit patterns
- Detect trends (e.g., "You're more productive on Tuesdays")
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Keep you motivated with personalized encouragement

## 💡 Why Build This?

Generic habit trackers exist. But they don't *learn* about YOU.

This app is different because it:
- Stores your personal history locally
- Analyzes YOUR unique patterns
- Gives YOU personalized advice (not generic tips)
- Helps you understand YOUR behavior

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI
- **Database**: SQLite
- **AI**: GLM API for intelligent insights
- **Frontend**: Clean, responsive HTML/CSS/JS

## 🔗 Try It Out

Clone it, install dependencies, and start tracking!

This is Week 1 of my **weekly AI app building challenge**. My goal: Build and ship one AI-powered app per week, share learnings, and improve my skills.

**Next week**: I'm thinking about a meeting notes AI that transcribes and extracts action items. Any suggestions?
